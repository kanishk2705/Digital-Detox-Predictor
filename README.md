## 🛠️ The Development Journey
This project was built iteratively, mimicking a real-world Agile development lifecycle.

###  Phase 1: Data Engineering & Analysis 
* **Goal:** Understand the "DNA" of digital addiction.
* **Actions:**
    * Cleaned raw data (handled missing values, outliers).
    * Engineered features: Converted categorical inputs (Platform, Gender) into numerical vectors using One-Hot Encoding.
    * **Key Insight:** Found a strong correlation between *Sleep Hours* and *Addiction Score*, but surprisingly, *Message-based apps* (like WhatsApp) showed lower addiction risks than *Scroll-based apps* (like TikTok).
